After Unzipping there will be msgproc/Q1 and msgproc/Q2 , Code of question 1 and Question 2 respectively.
Goto msgproc/Q1 and execute build.sh (sh build.sh). It will compile and create binaries of server and client.
open another terminal and execute server (./serv). From different terminal execute client (./client infile1.txt , ./client infile2.txt).
ctrl+c needs to be pressed to end the server when all clients are terminated.Server will create dump.txt and Outfile.txt
input files  are also given with the code as (infile1.txt,infile2.txt).
Same steps needs to be followd for msgproc/Q2 too.
